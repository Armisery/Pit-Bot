# Pit Bot made by Armisery/Kymp. #
### Assisted heavily by Omi and only put on github incase I need to reset my pc again. ###
Made public because this code doesn't function anymore it just gets the bots watchdog banned.
Anyone who wants to try create their own can use this code as I do not really care anymore, but the way it is launched it incredibly inefficient.
 ## Install: ##

  -pip install -r requirements.txt or just pip install requests

  -Install node.js

  -Do each individual command from node_requirements.txt

  -Put alts in alts.txt and proxies in proxies.txt. Alts must be in form of email:pass and proxies must be in form ip:port:user:pass

  -Set webhook link in grinderbot.js and/or silentbot.js depending on which one you are using.

  -Run Doxtrilauncher2.py
